OK BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE!

I ran this on NetBeans IDE with MySQL connection. It is a Hostel Management System where you are acting as the WARDEN of a hostel,
entering and altering Employee and Student details as and when needed. Also a mess table which is directly built into the code and
no SQL required. (You can add that functionality as it is quite limited in this project)

You will need a MySQL jar connector as well. Details on how you run MySQL are in this informative YT vid

Make sure to learn about MySQL commands and running its command line before implementing the project.

Best of luck!
